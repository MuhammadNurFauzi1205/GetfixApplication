## 1. Machine Learning
In this repository, files contain in the Image Classification and recomender directory are the final architecture that is most suitable for our project. We have done some research and development to build this project model. 

Tasks for the Machine Learning team:
- Collecting and Cleaning Dataset
- Build Model
- Train and Test Model
- Model Deployment

for the Image Classification for now it have 2 classes first is screen crash and second in blue screen,for the dataset for image Classification it have 600 images which is split to 300 for screen crash and 300 for blue screen.We build a model using conv2d,max_pooling 2d,dense and flatten layer,after we build a model we train it and we reach 0.97 accuracy.

for the recomender we using Classification multiclass using structured data that have 16 class depend on what user choose in the input.for the build a model we using StringLookup,CategoryEncoding,Concatenate,and Dense layer.aftre the model done we train it and give a 0.93 accuracy



## 2. Mobile Development
In this repository,files contain in app are the final 

The tech we use for create this app :
- Kotlin
- Firebase
- Retrofit
- Material design
- hilt
- Image Slider Show denzcoskun
- Rating Bar zhanghai
- Glide
- Tensorflow

Here the screenshot of the app :
