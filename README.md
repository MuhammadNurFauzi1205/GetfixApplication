## 1. Machine Learning
In this repository, files contain in the Image Classification and recomender directory are the final architecture that is most suitable for our project. We have done some research and development to build this project model. 

Tasks for the Machine Learning team:
- Collecting and Cleaning Dataset
- Build Model
- Train and Test Model
- Model Deployment

### Image Classification 
the model have 2 classes first is screen crash and second in blue screen,for the dataset for image Classification it have 600 images which is split to 300 for screen crash and 300 for blue screen.We build a model using conv2d,max_pooling 2d,dense and flatten layer,after we build a model we train it and we reach 0.97 accuracy.

### Recomender 
we using Multiclass Classification using structured data model that have 16 class depend on what user choose in the input.for the build a model we using StringLookup,CategoryEncoding,Concatenate,and Dense layer.after the model done we train it and give a 0.93 accuracy.
